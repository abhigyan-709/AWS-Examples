# though this is not very good approach in my sense but to cover some of the topics with advanced level of execution of the linux commands as well, we can go ahead with the AWS S3 Bash Scripting as well.

## AWS S3 Bash Scripting

## for the bash and shell scripting we generally use the .sh script so here we will go ahead with the notes and the .sh files in the directory will be used for the scripts

Please refer to the s3-bash-scripts for the better understanding of the bash scripts for the s3
and please use the below considerations to execute the bash shell in the scripting

1. Change or modify the permission to make the user able to execute the files
```bash
chmod 700 or 777 <folder-name> # for you local machine
ls -la # check the permissions if they are added or not
```
